# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation program

- Your First Neural Network: Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.
- Image classification: Build a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.
- Text Generation: Train a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.
- Machine Translation: Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)
- Face Generation: Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
