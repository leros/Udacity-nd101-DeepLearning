### Project 1: Your First Neural Network

Build a neural network from scratch to predict bike rentals.

### Project 2: Image Classification
Train convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### Project 3: TV Scripts Generation
Generate Simpsons TV scripts using Recursive Neural Networks(RNNs).

### Project 4: Machine Translation
Train a sequence to sequence(Seq2Seq) model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French.

### Project 5: Face Generation
Use generative adversarial networks(GANs) to generate new images of real faces.
